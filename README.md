#MEAN + Sequelize
###Stack Energize!

The aim of the project is to create a stack that can be conveniently used to cater to develop applications that can use both SQL-based DBs and Mongodb simultaneously and have a scaffolding mechanism to manage the whole application


The source code for the stack is based out of the MEAN.JS stack available [here](https://github.com/meanjs/mean), we have added the promise-based SQL ORM, Sequelize with the same. Sequelize can be seen [here](https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize).
